<row Id="16447" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2011-12-03T16:06:01.853" Score="0" ViewCount="349" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am interested in a launcher/home screen application which behaves like the classic Palm OS (not WebOS) launcher. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; installed application is in exactly one &lt;em&gt;category&lt;/em&gt;, and you can flip between categories. There is no separate app drawer versus home-screen. Ideally, I could reorganize the apps (and add shortcuts and widgets) within each category, and let the less-used part of that category be accessible by scrolling past the 'bottom' of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I get the impression that iOS (and so iOS-inspired Android launchers, presumably) does a similar thing of forcing each application to be on some page of the home screen, but I specifically want to have single categories larger than my screen size; e.g. &quot;Games&quot;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My goal is to make it harder to forget I have an app  because the standard app drawer is a big unorganized list, I hardly ever look at it, and when installing inessential things like games it's easy to forget to carefully add it to a folder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also like it to not have extra features which require extra permissions (widgets can check my calendar for me, thanks).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am currently using folders to organize my apps into categories (in the stock Android launcher), but this is an moderately unsatisfactory solution:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no Uncategorized folder which newly installed apps or &lt;em&gt;apps removed from other locations&lt;/em&gt; end up in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would like the rest of the category to be more naturally connected to the home screen (e.g. scrolling down) rather than being a single icon on it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would like to have more than five categories.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=10667&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a bug in the stock launcher&lt;/a&gt; in which the use of folders causes other home screen slots to misbehave.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="660" LastEditorUserId="660" LastEditDate="2011-12-03T16:57:59.123" LastActivityDate="2011-12-21T00:54:26.373" Title="Is there a Palm OS-style launcher (placing apps in categories)?"

Most other 3rd party launchers (adw, launcher pro, my personal favorite go launcher ex) do the same things but keep the app drawer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10243" LastActivityDate="2011-12-03T18:02:09.143" CommentCount="2" />
